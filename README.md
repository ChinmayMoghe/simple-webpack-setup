# Webpack setup project

## Goal
Understand various parts of webpack , how webpack works , this serves as a bare minimum configuration to run any modern web development project for me.

## Run this project
Use the following commands for various operations:

1. yarn install → Install project dependencies.
2. yarn add → add project dependencies (as required , add suffix -D for dev-dependencies)
3. yarn start → run this project (open up localhost:8080/ on browser)
4. yarn build → build the webpack bundle.
